# IBM-Data-Analysis-Project -README

## Project Overview
This project involves the complete process of data analysis, from data collection to the final presentation. Each module represents a crucial step in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The final presentation compiles the findings into a clear and compelling story.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Collection
- Collected data using APIs
- Scraped web data
- Explored the dataset

### Part 2: Data Wrangling
- Identified missing values
- Addressed missing data
- Found and removed duplicates
- Normalized the dataset

### Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed data distribution
- Identified outliers
- Explored correlations between variables

### Part 4: Data Visualization
- Visualized data distribution
- Explored relationships between variables
- Compared data trends
- Created composition charts

### Part 5: Dashboard Creation
- Developed interactive dashboards to present key insights

### Part 6: Presentation of Findings
- Compiled insights into a final presentation
- Structured data story in a clear and compelling manner
- Used PowerPoint to present findings with visuals

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- APIs & Web Scraping Tools
- PowerPoint (for final presentation)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Install Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`
3. Install necessary Python libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests`
4. Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. Review and execute each part to understand the data analysis process.

## Final Output
The final output of this project is a presentation that effectively communicates the findings derived from data analysis. The PowerPoint presentation summarizes the key insights, supported by data visualizations and dashboards.
